# Hook: Post Code Change

After making code changes, execute the following quality and verification steps:

---

## Required Steps

1. **Format & Lint**: Run formatting and linting for the modified files or package scripts:
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run format`

2. **Clean Code**: Remove unused imports, variables, class properties, or dead code.

3. **Security Check**: Verify that no credentials, passwords, client secrets, API tokens, or sensitive values were introduced.

4. **Alignment Verification**: Ensure all changes remain aligned with the [Core Engineering Guidelines](../../knowledge/core-engineering-guidelines.md).

5. **Generate Draft Report**: After all quality checks pass, generate a structured draft report based on your workflow type:
   - Follow the [Report Generation Skill](../report-generation/SKILL.md).
   - Use the appropriate template from `/.agents/report-templates/`.
   - Save the report to `.agents/reports/` with the naming convention: `[WORKFLOW-TYPE]-REPORT-[ID]-[DATE]-[TIME].ctx.md`.
